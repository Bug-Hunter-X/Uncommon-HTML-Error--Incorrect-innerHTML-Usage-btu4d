This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to the innerHTML property.  The `bug.html` file contains code that attempts to set the innerHTML of a div element to a JavaScript object. This results in an empty div because innerHTML expects a string. The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected version, which uses JSON.stringify to convert the object into a string representation before assigning it to innerHTML.
